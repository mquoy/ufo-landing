# ufo-landing
A mock webpage layout, part of The Odin Project.

## Design/Theme

I plan to design this page using UFOs and aliens as the theme. This is meant to be fun, weird, and clean. My inspiration: I adore The X-Files, and I thought this would be a way to keep the project interesting while working on the page.

## To-do

* fix the second signup button at the bottom of the page
